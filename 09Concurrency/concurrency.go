/**
 * Concurrency
 * deadlock = one thread has locked a piece of data but needs to also see another piece of data that is locked by a different thread.
 * Go uses communication channel instead of data itself to control action. Don't share data. It's messy.
 * Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
 * Go Routines
 * Lightweight thread. Managed by go runtime. Uses Keyword "go"
